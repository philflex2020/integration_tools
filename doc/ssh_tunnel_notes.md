ssh tunnel notes


ssh -L 3336:db001.host:3306 user@pub001.host
Copy
Once you run the command, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the remote SSH user password. Once entered, you will be logged into the remote server, and the SSH tunnel will be established. It is also a good idea to set up an SSH key-based authentication and connect to the server without entering a password.

Now, if you point your local machine database client to 127.0.0.1:3336, the connection will be forwarded to the db001.host:3306 MySQL server through the pub001.host machine that acts as an intermediate server.

You can forward multiple ports to multiple destinations in a single ssh command. For example, you have another MySQL database server running on machine db002.host, and you want to connect to both servers from your local client, you would run:

ssh -L 3336:db001.host:3306 3337:db002.host:3306 user@pub001.host
Copy
To connect to the second server, you would use 127.0.0.1:3337.
